## Intelligent Recommendation System for Coding Courses Based on Learner Behavior

This document describes the technical, computational, and organizational requirements necessary to reproduce, extend, and evaluate the proposed intelligent recommendation system.

---

## 1. Programming Language

- **Python ≥ 3.9**

Python is selected due to its strong ecosystem for:
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Sequential modeling
- Scientific computing
- Research reproducibility

---

## 2. Core Libraries

### 2.1 Machine Learning & Deep Learning

- **PyTorch**
  - Implementation of GRU-based Knowledge Tracing model
  - Training and evaluation of sequential neural networks

  - Evaluation metrics (AUC, accuracy, precision, recall)
  - Data preprocessing utilities

---

### 2.2 Data Processing & Analysis

- **Pandas**
  - Handling large-scale interaction logs
  - Dataset manipulation and aggregation

---

### 2.3 Visualization & Learning Analytics

- **Matplotlib**
  - Learning progress curves
  - EMA and cumulative accuracy plots

- **Seaborn**
  - Knowledge State Heatmap visualization
  - High-level statistical graphics for interpretability

## 3. Project Structure Requirements

The project follows a modular and research-oriented structure to ensure clarity, scalability, and academic reproducibility.


4. Dataset Requirements

4.1 Dataset Characteristics

The system assumes an educational interaction dataset with the following schema:
- student_id
- problem_id
- timestamp
- correctness (binary: 0 / 1)

4.2 Dataset Properties
- Sequential and time-ordered
- Sparse interaction matrix
- Implicit feedback (behavior-based inference)

4.3 Data Availability Policy
Important Notice:
The data/ directory is intentionally excluded from the public GitHub repository due to:
- Learner privacy protection
- Ethical research standards
- Dataset licensing restrictions

Researchers wishing to reproduce results must:
- Use a licensed educational dataset
- Or generate a synthetic dataset with identical structure

This decision aligns with best practices followed by top-tier academic institutions.

5. Hardware Requirements

Minimum Requirements:
- CPU-based execution
- 8 GB RAM

Recommended for Research-Scale Experiments:
- GPU (NVIDIA CUDA-enabled)
- ≥ 16 GB RAM

> GPU acceleration significantly reduces training time for GRU-based models on long learner sequences.

6. Reproducibility Considerations
- Fixed random seeds are recommended
- Consistent train-validation-test splits should be used
- Model checkpoints should be saved during training
- Hyperparameters should be documented in the experiment logs

7. Ethical & Academic Compliance
This project is designed in compliance with:
- Educational data mining ethics
- Reproducible research principles
- Transparent machine learning standards

> The system is intended for research and educational use, not for automated high-stakes decision-making.

8. Summary
The requirements outlined above ensure that the project:
- Meets academic research standards
- Can be reliably reproduced and extended
- Is suitable for evaluation in top-tier university environments
- Aligns with ethical and legal data handling practices

This foundation enables future researchers to build upon the system with confidence and clarity.
